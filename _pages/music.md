I love music. It is by far my favourite artfom as it makes the otherwise (imo) stale and boring world seem vibrant and unfamiliar. What's more is that there is always new music to be discovered. I love exploring the endless sea of genres out there and listening to sounds I've never heard before. In fact, most my favourite songs are very different from the norm and can be somewhat daunting on the first listen. However, theses are usually the ones that have the most depth and that keep being interesting no matter how many times you listen to them.

Anyways, this post isn't a list of the songs I think have the sickest bass or the tightest beats. I seriously encourage you to take a step back and really familiarize yourself if a song strikes your interest. I promise it's worth it!

# Top 250 Albums

Here is a spotify playlist with my favourite 250 albums with one song from each album. They are ranked from favourite (album) to least favourite (of the 250). If there is a song you like, check out the album! The rest of the songs on there are usually equally good and keeps the vibe going.

This is my Handbook that I use as a 'Cheat Sheet' when working with Data Science. It has been crafted to work with my personal workflow so it might not be universally applicable. 
Feel free to use it, though. 
Keep in mind that university is giving me a lot of information and I'm trying to keep these 'Cheat Sheets' as short, comprehensive and relevant as possible. I will do several revisions over time.

This is a short announcement about a "golf" game I'm working on based on the mechanics of Kirby's Dream Course (Kirby Ball) from 1994.

I've hit a wall in development, mainly because I've never made a game before and making one is (surprisingly) not that easy.

The graphics are no longer a problem, I've become reasonably comfortable with pixel art and have been able to work around any problems that have come up in terms of visuals.

Personally, I think it looks pretty good:

{% include figure image_path="/images/slime-golf/slime1.gif" alt="this is a placeholder image" %}
Here is some early stage pixel art:

{% include gallery id="gallery" %}

I've also been working on some sprites for building levels (very early stage):

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

Here is an early look at how 3d physics are going to feel in the 2d-isometric environment:

{% include figure image_path="/images/slime-golf/physics.gif" alt="this is a placeholder image" %}

Again, this is a very early look at the game. I definitely think it has potential to become a good successor for Kirby's Dream Course although I am thinking of making a lot of alterations in how the game is played (just to make it new and interesting. I have so, so many ideas that I hope to include and it's going to be awesome!).

I have an undying love for Kirby and especially Kirby's Dream Course which is why I'm determined to finish this game no matter what. Working on this game has been an absolute joy so far, I will post more updates when I feel like I've made some progress.

Thanks for reading!

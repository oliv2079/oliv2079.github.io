This is a short announcement about a "golf" game I'm working on based on the mechanics of Kirby's Dream Course (Kirby Ball) from 1994.

I've hit a wall in development, mainly because I've never made a game before and making one is (surprisingly) not that easy.

The graphics are no longer a problem, I've become reasonably comfortable with pixel art and have been able to work around any problems that have come up in terms of visuals.

Personally, I think it looks pretty good:

{% include figure image_path="/images/slime-golf/slime1.gif" alt="this is a placeholder image" %}

Here are some early stage pixel art:

{% include gallery %}
